### 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate Computer Science graduate with a strong inclination towards full-stack development and hardware integration. My interests lie in:

- **Hardware Mastery**: Studying motherboard schematics from phones to computers to gain deep hardware understanding.
- **Real-World Networking**: Hands-on experience with server rack installation, gateway configuration, and domain/network setup during fieldwork at Kasulu Teachers College.
- **Open Source Software**: Actively working on practical systems like Parcel Transportation, e-Pharmacy, and School Management.
